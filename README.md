# how to install

click clone or download and select download zip

extract the zip

run installer.bat

follow insructions

enjoy custom skins in education edition!

# why was this made?

this was made because i found a way to install custom skins on my pc but was very hard to do and the fact my friends wanted to have custom skins. also they are poor and cant have java like me

# requirements

admin

# cleaning up

delete skin.png, install.bat and skins.json

# todo

*somehow* make the installer work with the appx version (which i wont do appx sux when you do mods)

make a gui (HSGyGYIGSIUGUUDI)

make a version for "slim"  type of skins

auto remaming of skins
